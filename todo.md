3. ~~Implement game phases~~  
   Also includes making sure each place that depends on phases uses those
4. ~~Save player location~~
5. ~~Load player location~~
6. ~~Load game state (background)~~
7. ~~Add a test-specific library to get hands on internal services (in order to spy on them)~~
8. ~~Test the setBackground command~~
9. ~~Rework how background is stored~~
10. ~~Test if loading game sets the background properly~~
11. ~~Test loading player location~~
12. ~~Solve the problem with registering for persistence - use an initializer of some sorts for this?~~
