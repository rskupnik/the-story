{< color:#3F3F3FFF  Outside the cell}

You're outside the cell, at least as far as you can tell in the total darkness. You can barely notice an {< color:#3F3F3FFF|clickable:true|id:desk_0_0|def:desk_0 old desk} in the corner.

There doesn't seem to be any exit from here apart from going back to the cell.
